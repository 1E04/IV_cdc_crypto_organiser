## The Problem to solve
I'm using a crypto broker to invest and trade with cryptocurrency. But in Germany you have to pay taxes if you make some money out of this. After one year the coins are tax free. I need a visual system, which led me know, when and how many coins are free to sell or when I want to sell more, howmany taxes i would have to pay. The complexity leads to that the prices change all the time and this is important, if you wanna sell under one year. How much win/loss you did with this coin.
