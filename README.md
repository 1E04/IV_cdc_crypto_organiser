## What is the problem?

As someone who invests in cryptocurrencies, I face the same problem every year: the complexity of my tax return. In Germany in particular, profits from cryptocurrency transactions have to be taxed unless you hold the coins for more than 365 days. This makes calculating a profit/loss statement for my purchases and sales a real challenge.
