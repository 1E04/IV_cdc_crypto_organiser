## The Problem to solve
In Germany, you have to pay tax on your income. Even if you earn money from trading shares or cryptocurrencies. But there is a difference in how German law categorizes stocks and cryptos. If you hold cryptocurrencies for more than 365 days, you don't have to pay tax.

The complexity of the tax declaration increases if you buy and sell coins at different prices and at different times. This tool is initially meant to be an organizer that records when and how many coins were bought and sold, but after that it is meant to help you do your tax return faster and without doubt. The tool lets you know when you can sell coins and how many of them are tax-free. Otherwise, the tool should check if you sold a year ago, how much income or losses you made. 
The income is calculated with the scheme - first in, first out - which means, the first token you buy, will be the same token when you sell some. 
I need to get an overview of, when I can sell coins tax free or check, when i want to sell some now, how much income or loss I gain.

## What kind of buissness logic
To offer a tool that allows the user to upload his transaction history and provide an evaluation that will help him with his tax return.
