## User Journey

I'm as a user of this application, go on the website and want to log in with on my personal account.
I am uploading my new transaction history and I add manuel a new transaction. I switch to the overview page and can see all the coins I held, and how many from each are tax free and ready to sell. After checking this I check, how many income I gain, when I willsell 100 coins now. The tool delivers me the answer and say that I will make 100€ of profit, but from the 100 coins are only 70 tax free. It shows me that I gained 15€ with the 30 coins I bought later and that I have to pay taxes on this income. The other income of 85€ from coins I bought earlier are tax free.

Now I am thinking about selling only 70 coins and log out of my account.
